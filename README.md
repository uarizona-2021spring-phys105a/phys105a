The project deadlines are 12:00am May 4th for Session 1 and 12:00am
April 29th for Session 2.
The two sessions will coordinate a single time slot to present their
projects.
The
[final exam schedule](https://registrar.arizona.edu/courses/final-examination-schedule-spring-2021)
will be helpful in selecting such a time.


<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
## Grading Scale and Policies

There are 8 assignments and 2 projects in total.
Each assignment worth 10 points and each project worth 20 points.

This course provides regular letter grades (A–E), which are based on a
simple point system:

* A: 80–100  points
* B: 70–79.9 points
* C: 60–69.9 points
* D: 50–59.9 points
* E:  0–49.9 points

No scaling will be applied.
Nevertheless, the points for a student's worst two assignments or one
project will not be counted.

**Incomplete (I) or Withdrawal (W):**
Incomplete (I) or withdrawal (W) grades must be made in accordance
with University policies, which are available at
[here](http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/grades-and-grading-system#incomplete)
and
[here](http://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/grades-and-grading-system#Withdrawal),
respectively.

**Dispute of Grade Policy:**
If a student disagrees on his or her grade on an assignment or
project, the student must send the instructor a formal request through
email to re-evaluate the grade within a week from the time that the
student receives the grade.
Because no scale will be applied in the final grade, the final grade
cannot be re-evaluated.
The student is expected to know of his or her own performance through
out the course.
